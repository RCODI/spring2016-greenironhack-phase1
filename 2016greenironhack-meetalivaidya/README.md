The solution will provide an interface where people can search for neaby Farmers Markets, stands etc and their schedule. It will also show the available products, suggest fresh produce to buy and provide location and directions for a particular farmers market. The interface needs to be interactive in order to increase usage of the website and encourage people to buy seasonal & fresh products from farmers markets. Farmers Markets Directory and Geographic Data provided by US Department of Agriculture & weather data provided by National weather service is used for this project.
