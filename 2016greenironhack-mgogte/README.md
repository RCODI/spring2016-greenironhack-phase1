Introduction:
Application Name : Fresh Basket
Problem : 
Prices and freshness of vegetables are always fluctuating based on the weather conditions and pricing changes at farmer’s markets and supermarkets and stocking days at various shtores. This makes it difficult for individuals to decide which stores to shop from if they want the most fresh vegetables at an affordable price.

Description :
Fresh Basket is a web application which will help users make a healthy and budget friendly choice when shopping for fresh greens and produce. It tells grocery shoppers where and when they can find fresh vegetables at the cheapest price near them.

Approach :
This web application adopts a data driven approach and displays the processed data in easy to understand lists and visually appealing yet accurate maps.

Datasets:
The first data set I will be using gives details about pricing and other features of Farmer’s market:
http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/farmers-markets-2015
The second dataset pertains to the weather conditions that affect agriculture. It can be found at the following URL
http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/ANNUAL/stations/COOP:129430/detail
The application will use algorithms that takes each of these features into consideration i.e. Optimal weather conditions for agriculture, seasonal variations of different vegetables, stocking patterns for stores, price changes in the market etc, and assign weights to each of these features. Using a combination of these weighted features, the algorithm will come up with a list of supermarkets that are recommended for the user. This list will also be plotted on a map.
