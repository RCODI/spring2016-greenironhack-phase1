2.	Name of the application: Cheap and fresh vegetables in Lafayette
3.	Keywords: farmer market, location, temperature, price
4.	Description of the datasets and function design: 
First dataset:
Climate data online: 
http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/climate-data-online-cdo
Data set provides daily summaries of temperature, precipitation, wind, and degree days as well as radar data and 30-year Climate Normals.
Second dataset: Farmers market data. (Still looking for the data set)
5.	Problem addressed:  When and where you can get the cheapest and best local produce from local markets in the city of Lafayette?
6.	Solution: I wish to provide real time data about the best place to buy cheap and fresh vegetables based on userâ€™s location, current weather condition and location of the market. 

Current approach:
1. Explore datasets related to weather and farmer's market.
2. Explore Google map API as that will be a major part of the website.
3. Explore graph visulaisation libraries. 
4. Create a basic website for submission 1 consisting of a basic map to beign with.
