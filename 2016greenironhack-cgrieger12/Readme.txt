	[Yes] [List] Are all these datasets from data.gov? If not, where are they coming from (links)?

Brief Descritpion:
	What I would like to do with this project is have a consumer type in what kind of vegetable they would like to buy and then the program would search through the closest farmers markets to see if they would have the vegetable and also search through the dataset to see how much this vegetable should cost them. Also it would search through the climate data to see if the farmers market has had vegetables from a great climate environment when they were grown. 


Fill in the structued description: The following where it says Y is meant to be in the project if it is functional. 

Map View:

[Y] Basic Map with specific location (your map is located in a meaningful place, city of west lafayette for example)
[Y] Markers for location of markets
[Y] Labels for markets' names
[Y] InfoWindow to show detail information of a market
[N] [describe] Any other cover on the map (for example, cloud cover to show the weather effect)

[N] [describe] Use Graph? What is the type? (bar chart, pie chart, radar chart ...)
[N] [List] Any interaction available on the graph? List them (enable click on numbers, drag on lines, change time/variables ...)
Interaction Form:

[Y] [List] Any information output? list them. 
	There will be a text feild for the customer to enter a vegetable and most likely an area for a location they want to go.
[Y] [List] Any operation option (filters)? List them. (I will try to integrate search markets, search vegetables, filter based on price, sort based on convenience)

[N] [List] Interaction with Map? List them. (filter on price will affect map markers, sort on price will affect map markers, ...)
[Y] [List] Interaction with data visualization? List them. Will try to filter based on preferences.
