Purdue Iron Hack Fresh Vegetables Application

1. Keywords: Fresh, Vegetables, Farmers, Market, Climate

2. Description of the datasets and function design: I have not yet determined what datasets or functions I will need, I am still in the design phase.

3. Brief Description

Fill in the structued description:

Map View:

I plan to have the map along with markers for the locations, labels, and an InfoWindow. I don't know if I will incluse any covers on the map at this time.

Data Visualization:

[Y] [describe] Use Graph? What is the type? (bar chart, pie chart, radar chart ...)
I want to have a Freshness Scale which will show the user how fresh the vegetables are on a scale of 1-10. I also want to have a clock which will show the time.

[Y] [List] Any interaction available on the graph? List them (enable click on numbers, drag on lines, change time/variables ...)
Interaction Form: I want to have a clock in which the user can click on it and drag it to a time, then it will show the user if the market will be open or closed at that time. I have included in my picture what I want the Freshness Scale to look like, a long line with a marker that can be moved back and forth.

[Y] [List] Any information output? list them. (text field, text area, label, plain HTML ...)
Most likely I will include text fields, text areas, and labels.

[Y] [List] Any operation option (filters)? List them. (search markets, search vegetables, filter based on price, sort based on convenience ...)
Search markets, search vegetables, filter on price, filter on times open/closed, which market is closest.

[Y/N] [List] Any information input? List them. (comments, markers, user preference ...)
Not sure yet.

[Y] [List] Interaction with Map? List them. (filter on price will affect map markers, sort on price will affect map markers, ...)
Sorting on whichever area they choose will limit the markers on the map to that criteria. I plan to have a seperate Search panel in which the user can input the search criteria that they wish (As shown in picture).

[Y] [List] Interaction with data visualization? List them. (filter, sort, set variables ...)
Yes, I would like the user to be able to move the Freshness Scale and I would like an interactive clock for hours of operation.

3. Build Case How can we build and access your project on a Linux/Unix machine if you use external dependencies besides HTML/CSS/Javascript? List the dependencies you used, such as python, node.js, etc. List the steps we should follow to build the project. Your project will be built on Amazon Web Service, EC2, ubuntu 14.01 instance

Not yet determined


4. Test Case Which browsers did you test your project on? Chrome, IE, Edge, Safari, or Firefox?

None so far

Additional information You Want to Share with Us E.g. any problems you faced/fixed, where you reached out to for help, etc.
- I only included a hand-drawn picture of what I would like the design for the application to be. I have started to create my webpage but I am very new at this and it has been taking me much longer than expected to get the hang of things. I am also using my home computer this weekend and my internet is so slow I couldn't download the necessary files/programs that I need to complete my application. By the next phase, I will have a working model. Right now I would love comments on my design.
