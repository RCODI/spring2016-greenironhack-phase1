1. chpfr.sh
2. fresh, cheap, local
3.- online climate data - data.gov
  - Farmers Markets Directory and Geographic Data - data.gov
  - Food Price Outlook - data.gov
4. My project will be a website where it shows users where the cheap and fresh vegetables are. The website will first allow users to input their geographic location. Then after the users have inputed  their location the system will use the above data sets to find and display where the cheapest and freshest produce are. The website will also allow users to input what they consider most important to them. For example, if they don't care about the price or location and only want the freshest produce. They can specify that on the webpage. The webpage will contain many visuals for easier use for the user. It will have maps of the Greater Lafayette region showing the market locations. 
5. This entire project will be coded with Javascript with HTML and CSS.
