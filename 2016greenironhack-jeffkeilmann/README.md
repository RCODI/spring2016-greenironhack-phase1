1. The name of my application is Kick-Ass Crops.

2. Keywords: Price, Freshness, Availability

3. Currently, I have used no datasets, but I intend to use the required Climate
dataset, as well as farmers market data in Chicago and some data that I will scrape
from local grocery stores. I am also looking into using the Yelp API to display
store ratings.

4. Kick-Ass Crops will help a user find the best, freshest, cheapest fruits and
vegetables in the area. It will accomplish this by sorting through climate data
to determine what might be available locally given precipitation figures, and
scraping through stores in the area to determine where the user might find the
best and cheapest produce. Kick-Ass Crops will also serve as an excellent source
for cross referencing store qualities, as Yelp reviews for each store will be 
available side by side along with the price of their desired produce. If a given
plant is either unavailable (out of season, etc.) or too expensive for the user,
Kick-Ass Crops will provide them with an alternative that they might also enjoy.

Map View:

Y - Basic Map with specific location (your map is located in a meaningful place, city of west lafayette for example)
Y - Markers for location of markets
Y - Labels for markets' names
Y - InfoWindow to show detail information of a market
N - [Nothing planned yet] Any other cover on the map (for example, cloud cover to show the weather effect)

Data Visualization:

N - [Nothing planned yet] Use Graph? What is the type? (bar chart, pie chart, radar chart ...)
N - [^] Any interaction available on the graph? List them (enable click on numbers, drag on lines, change time/variables ...)

Interaction Form: < I have left this information out for now. I feel like it is pretty useless to fill in until I have an actual
prototype.

[Y/N] [List] Any information output? list them. (text field, text area, label, plain HTML ...)
[Y/N] [List] Any operation option (filters)? List them. (search markets, search vegetables, filter based on price, sort based on convenience ...)
[Y/N] [List] Any information input? List them. (comments, markers, user preference ...)
[Y/N] [List] Interaction with Map? List them. (filter on price will affect map markers, sort on price will affect map markers, ...)
[Y/N] [List] Interaction with data visualization? List them. (filter, sort, set variables ...)

5. Nothing to build... yet :)

6. No testing... yet :)
