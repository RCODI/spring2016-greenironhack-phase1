1. Application name: Go Veg, Go Fresh
2. My Application will use availability, freshness, Pricing, and Distance to distinguish the vendors.
3. Description of the datasets and function design:

  a. I will be making use of two data sets:
    i. The first data set is the climate data from the national weather service site; http://weather.noaa.gov/. The mandatory data set from the link of climate data online is actually pulled from the national weather service site so I would be using this link http://weather.noaa.gov/ directly to use the climate data.
    ii. The second data set that I will use is the farmers markets data from data.gov. The link to this data set is http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/farmers-markets-2015.
  
  b. Instead of using the primary data set from climate data online I have used the data from the national weather service site. The climate data online site pulls its data from the national weather service site.
  
  c. The links of the data sets that I am using are mentioned in point a. Apart from that I will be using the data for the recipes from http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dca/supp_info/farmers_market4.html.

4. My application integrates the climate data and the farmers market data to list the vendors in the city of chicago. These vendors are marked on a google map and clicking on any one marker will display the information about that vendor. This information will include their name, address, a bar graph that will rate the four parameters (pricing, availability, freshness, and distance) on a scale from 0 to 10, an overall score and recommendation. Apart from this the application will also show seasonal data of which fruits and vegetables are the freshest depending on the month. I will also make an attempt to show some recipes.

  Map View:
  
  a. I have made use of a basic map to show the vendor location
  
  b. There are markers used on the map.
  
  c. I have sued labels for each marker.
  
  d. There is an Info Window to show the detail information of a vendor.
  
  e, There is no otehr cover on the map.
  
  Data Visualization:
  
  a. I have used bar graph in this application.
  
  b. There is no graph interaction.
  
  Interaction Form:
  
  a. The only interaction available is the map interaction; i.e. when the user clicks on a marker on the map the info window will display the details of that vendor. Apart from thsi there is no interaction available.
  
5. At this point I am still exploring ways to make the project accessible. More details will be posted in the subsequent phases.
6. The application will only be tested in Chrome.
7. So far the only challenge has been to understand the problem statement and come up with a solution that I can implement given my limited expereince with Java Script
